To install a working Tekton server and configure it for use in a development, test, and production promotion cycle, you can follow these steps using Ansible roles:

1. First, create an Ansible playbook to install the necessary dependencies on the `waza` machine, including Docker and Kubernetes. You can use the following code as a starting point:
```yaml
---
- name: Install dependencies for Tekton server
  hosts: waza
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Install Docker
      apt:
        name: docker
        state: present
      become: true

    - name: Install Kubernetes
      apt:
        name: kubectl
        state: present
      become: true
```
2. Next, create an Ansible role to install and configure the Tekton server on the `waza` machine. You can use the following code as a starting point:
```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure Tekton server
  hosts: waza
  become: true

  roles:
    - { role: tekton, state: present }

  tasks:
    - name: Configure Tekton server for development environment
      include_tasks: dev-environment.yml

    - name: Configure Tekton server for test environment
      include_tasks: test-environment.yml

    - name: Configure Tekton server for production environment
      include_tasks: prod-environment.yml
```
In this code, the `tekton` role is used to install and configure the Tekton server on the `waza` machine. The `dev-environment`, `test-environment`, and `prod-environment` tasks are included for each environment.

3. Create an Ansible playbook to deploy your application to the Tekton server. You can use the following code as a starting point:
```yaml
---
- name: Deploy application to Tekton server
  hosts: waza
  become: true

  roles:
    - { role: tekton, state: present }

  tasks:
    - name: Build application image
      command: docker build -t myapp .
      args:
        chdir: /path/to/myapp

    - name: Push application image to registry
      command: docker push myregistry.com/myapp

    - name: Deploy application to Tekton server
      tekton:
        deploy:
          - name: myapp
            namespace: default
            replicas: 1
            containers:
              - name: myapp
                image: myregistry.com/myapp
```
In this code, the `tekton` role is used to deploy your application to the Tekton server on the `waza` machine. The `build`, `push`, and `deploy` tasks are included for building, pushing, and deploying the application image to the Tekton server.

4. Finally, create an Ansible playbook to run automated tests for your React and Python code. You can use the following code as a starting point:
```yaml
---
- name: Run automated tests for React and Python code
  hosts: waza
  become: true

  roles:
    - { role: tekton, state: present }

  tasks:
    - name: Run React tests
      command: npm run test
      args:
        chdir: /path/to/myapp/frontend

    - name: Run Python tests
      command: python manage.py test
      args:
        chdir: /path/to/myapp/backend
```
In this code, the `tekton` role is used to run automated tests for your React and Python code on the Tekton server on the `waza` machine. The `npm run test` and `python manage.py test` commands are included for running the tests.

Note that these are just examples, and you may need to modify them based on your specific needs and environment. Additionally, you will need to ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed on your machines before running these playbooks.
