1. Install tekton server on waza (debian) using ansible role.
2. Configure development machine (weywot macos) to work with tekton.
3. Set up promotion cycle and autoamted tests for react and python code on waza (debian).
4. Use the existing machines to automate deployments, testing, and production promotion.

Here's a sample ansible role that can help you achieve these configurations:
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
 vars:
 # Define variables for the ansible role
 roles:
 - {role: "tekton",
 module: "setup_server"
 }
 tasks:
 - name: Configure development machine (weywot macos) to work with tekton
 hosts: weywot
 tasks:
 - include_role: tekton
 - include_tasks:
 - {task: setup_server, role: "development"}
 - {task: setup_server, role: "production"}
 - {task: setup_server, role: "testing"}
 
- name: Set up promotion cycle and autoamted tests for react and python code on waza (debian)
 hosts: waza
 tasks:
 - include_role: tekton
 - include_tasks:
 - {task: setup_server, role: "production"}
 - {task: test, role: "testing"}
 
- name: Use the existing machines to automate deployments, testing, and production promotion
 hosts: all
 tasks:
 - include_role: tekton
 - include_tasks:
 - {task: setup_server, role: "development"}
 - {task: setup_server, role: "production"}
 - {task: setup_server, role: "testing"}
 
- name: Autoamted tests for react and python code on waza (debian)
 hosts: waza
 tasks:
 - include_role: tekton
 - include_tasks:
 - {task: setup_server, role: "production"}
 - {task: test, role: "testing"}
```
This ansible role assumes that you have already installed tekton server on your machine. You can install it using the following commands:
1. For macos: ```brew install tekton/tekton-server --with-python=py3```.
2. For debian machines: ```apt-get update && apt-get install -y tekton-server```
You will also need to have ansible installed and running on all the machines you want to automate deployments, testing, and production promotion. You can install it using the following commands:
1. For macos: ```brew install ansible```
2. For debian machines: ```apt-get update && apt-get install -y ansible```.
