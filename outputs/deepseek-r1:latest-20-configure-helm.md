Okay, I need to help the user create Ansible roles to install Docker and Helm on their machines. Let me break down what they asked for.

First, they mentioned having three machines with different hostnames: weywot (MacOS), yerbouti (Debian generic), and waza (Debian main server). The goal is to write Ansible roles that can be applied to these hosts.

They specifically want Docker and Helm installed so they can use them on their servers. So, I'll need to create separate roles for installing each, maybe a base role first, then specific ones for each machine type if needed.

I should consider the differences between the machines. For instance, waza is Debian-based, so it might be easier to install Docker and Helm there compared to weywot on macOS. Yerbouti is another Debian host but generic, which might have slightly different package names or Docker installation paths.

Let me think about the structure of an Ansible role. It should include tasks for installing Docker first because Helm relies on it. Then, install Helm using the helm command. After that, ensuring the packages are available in /etc/apt is a good idea to avoid future issues.

I'll create a base role called install-docker-and-helm. Within this role, I'll define tasks: one for installing Docker version 5 or higher on Debian and macOS, then another for installing Helm from the repository.

But wait, since waza is the main server, maybe it's better to have separate roles for each machine type. So, a generic role for Debian hosts like yerbouti, another for waza as the main server, and one specifically for weywot on macOS.

For the generic Debian role, I'll include tasks that install Docker Core and then Helm. For waza, perhaps after installing the base role, add more tasks to set system directories correctly because it's a production server with specific paths like /var/lib/helm.

Also, including a summary and debug statements in each role will help the user see if something goes wrong.

I should make sure that all commands are actual Ansible commands. For example, using playbooks or modules isn't necessary here since we're just using shell commands within tasks.

Finally, I'll provide instructions on how to use these roles: applying them with run_by=role, using files and tasks in the specified order, and explaining what each task does so the user understands why certain steps are taken.

Here is an Ansible role that installs Docker and Helm:

```ansible
become
module_name = "install_docker_and_helm"
version = "1.0"

state = "present"

def main():
    """
    Installs Docker Core and Helm on the system.
    """
    Playbook = tmp Playbook named "docker-helm.yml" in /var/www/html/ansible/roles/

    Playbook.add_file("/var/www/html/ansible/roles/%s/inventory/debian_inventory.yml")
    Playbook.add_file("/var/www/html/ansible/roles/%s/inventory/macOS_inventory.yml")

    Playbook.play()

    if Hostvars.get('os') == 'mac':
        Set juggernaut=macOS

    if Hostvars.get('os') in ['debian', 'ubuntu']:
        Set architecture=64bit
```

You can run this role using:

```bash
ansible playbooks /path/to/roles/inventory/debian_inventory.yml -i install_docker_and_helm.yml -f docker-helm.yml
```

### Instructions:
1. Create a `playbooks` directory in your project root.
2. Create an `inventory` directory within `playbooks`.
3. Copy the inventory files for each machine (weywot, yerbouti, waza) into the `playbooks/inventory/` directory with appropriate hostnames.
4. Run the role using the command above.

### Notes:
- This role assumes that Docker Core is available on your system and will automatically update to a newer version if needed.
- Helm will be installed in its default location unless specified otherwise.
- Ensure that you have sufficient permissions to install software on all target machines.

Would you like me to create separate roles for each machine type (Debian, macOS) or modify this role further?
