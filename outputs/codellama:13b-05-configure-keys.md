Here is an Ansible role that installs software packages on every host and configures SSH keys for use with Ansible:
```yaml
---
- name: Install required software packages
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Detect OS type
      command: uname -a
      register: os_type

    - name: Install package manager for {{ os_type }}
      {% if os_type == 'Darwin' %}
        brew install packages-to-install
      {% elif os_type == 'Linux' %}
        apt install packages-to-install
      {% endif %}

    - name: Configure SSH keys for Ansible
      command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
      register: ssh_keys

    - name: Add public key to authorized_keys file
      authorized_keys: "{{ ssh_keys.stdout }}"
```
This role will install the software packages `packages-to-install` on every host, and configure SSH keys for use with Ansible. The `command` module is used to execute shell commands, while the `register` keyword is used to save the output of a command as a variable. The `authorized_keys` task adds the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote host.

You can run this role by executing the following command:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts install-software-packages.yml
```
Replace `hosts` with the path to your inventory file, and `install-software-packages.yml` with the name of the playbook you want to execute.
