Okay, I need to figure out how to create an Ansible role to install and configure a Tekton server on my existing machines. The user provided three hosts: weywot (MacOS development laptop), yerbouti (Debian generic host), and waza (Debian main server for testing, production, and database). 

First, I'll start by setting up the Ansible environment. I know that using a YAML file in the roles directory is standard. The role should be named something like 'tekton_server' to clearly indicate its purpose.

Next, I need to decide which hosts will run Tekton. Since waza is specified as the main server, it makes sense to install Tekton there. Yerbouti can also be included for testing purposes, while weywot, being a Mac, might not be suitable for the server role but could be used for development tasks.

Looking at the dependencies, Kubectl and Docker are essential for Kubernetes interactions and containerization. I'll include these as prerequisites to ensure they're installed on all relevant hosts.

For the Tekton installation, using the official documentation is key. The script will handle downloading and setting up the necessary components. I should set variables like $KUBERNETES_VERSION and $TEKTON_VERSION to keep things flexible and version-controlled.

Post-installation steps include verifying that the server and dashboard are running correctly. Configuration files forTekton need to be in place, so I'll create a tasks directory with any needed YAML files.

I also want to automate testing using pytest. Setting up a virtual environment on waza ensures that tests run consistently. The user mentioned React and Python projects, so including these in the test suite makes sense.

In summary, the Ansible role will handle installing dependencies, setting up Tekton, verifying its status, and automating tests. By structuring it this way, it should meet the requirements for a development, testing, and production environment.

Here's an Ansible role to install and configure a Tekton server along with automated testing:

```yaml
---
- name: Install dependencies
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure python3 is installed
      apt:
        name: python3
        state: present
    - name: Ensure pip is installed
      apt:
        name: python3-pip
        state: present
    - name: Ensure kubectl is installed
      apt:
        name: kubectl
        state: present
        force: yes
    - name: Ensure docker is installed
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present

- name: Install and configure Tekton
  hosts: waza,yerbouti
  tasks:
    - name: Download and install Tekton CLI
      shell: |
        curl -Lo tektonctl.gz "https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases/download/v{{ TEKTON_VERSION }}/tektonctl-linux-amd64.gz"
        gunzip -c tektonctl.gz > /usr/local/bin/tektonctl
        chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tektonctl

    - name: Set up Tekton components
      shell: |
        kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/publisher/previous/0.14.2/release-0.14.2.yaml
        kubectl wait --for=condition=available pods -l app= tekton-pipelines-controller -n tekton-pipelines

    - name: Verify Tekton installation
      shell: |
        kubectl get pods -n tekton-pipelines

- name: Set up automated testing
  hosts: waza
  tasks:
    - name: Create test directory
      file:
        path: /var/test
        state: directory

    - name: Install pytest and dependencies
      shell: |
        python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      shell: |
        pytest --cov . tests/ && coverage report
```

Use this role with the following variables:

```yaml
---
TEKTON_VERSION: "0.14.2"
KUBERNETES_VERSION: "1.25.2"
```

This Ansible role will:
- Install Python3 and pip on all hosts
- Install Docker and kubectl on all hosts
- Set up Tekton components on waza and yerbouti
- Create a test directory and set up automated testing on waza

Note: Replace `requirements.txt` with your actual requirements file containing pytest and other dependencies needed for your projects.

To use this role, add it to your playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Tekton server and testing environment
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: tekton_server
```

This will ensure a consistent setup across your development, test, and production environments.
