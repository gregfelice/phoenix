Okay, so I need to help set up a system environment using Ansible roles. The user wants an Ansible role that installs a PostgreSQL server on their specified machines. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should outline what needs to be done. The main tasks are setting up the PostgreSQL instance and making sure it's running across all the target hosts. Since the user has already mentioned three hosts: weywot, yerbouti, and waza (as the main server), I can focus on those.

I know that Ansible roles are created using Ansible's Ansible CLI. The structure would typically involve creating a new role named "pg" which runs the pg instance command. Then, each target host will have their own copy of this role so they can run it in parallel or asynchronously if needed.

I should also consider any dependencies. If the PostgreSQL service is running in production, I might need to ensure that it's not stopping unless specified. But since the user hasn't mentioned any specific timeouts or restarts, maybe just initializing it is sufficient for now.

Wait, I should check if the pg service can be restarted. In Ansible, by default, services are single-node and restart automatically when a new job runs. So, as long as the role "pg" is running on each target host, the server will start up when the Ansible job is executed.

Now, let's think about how to structure the Ansible CLI commands. First, I'll create the pg role using Ansible's roles CLI. Then, for each hostname, I'll create a new role that depends on the pg role running and starts it. Since the user wants only one instance per host, maybe having multiple instances isn't necessary unless specified.

I should also consider any potential issues. For example, if the PostgreSQL service is already running in production or was just started, would this cause conflicts? I think Ansible handles service restarts automatically, so it shouldn't matter as long as we're initializing it correctly.

Another point: are there any specific configurations needed for the PostgreSQL server on these hosts? Maybe setting up a database URL and port. But since the user didn't mention that, perhaps it's beyond the current scope unless they specify later.

I should also think about how to test this setup. After creating the roles, running Ansible commands like 'ansible targets list' will show all the target hosts, each with their own pg role. This way, I can verify that the PostgreSQL server is starting correctly on each machine.

Wait, but if the user wants only one instance per host, maybe using a single socket service would be better to avoid conflicts. Alternatively, having multiple instances might be acceptable unless they have strict limits set up for production environments.

But since the user hasn't provided any such configuration yet, perhaps I can mention that as an option or leave it at the initial setup without adding anything specific, just follow their instructions.

In summary, create a pg role in Ansible, each target host gets its own copy of this role to start the PostgreSQL server. Ensure that the roles are set up so they run concurrently if needed. Test by running Ansible commands to see all targets and verify each has its own pg instance.

To set up an Ansible role for installing a PostgreSQL server across your specified machines, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Postgres Role:**
   ```bash
   ansible roles create pg
   ```

2. **Create Target Roles (Each Target Host Gets Its Own Instance):**

   For weywot:
   ```bash
   ansible roles create weywot-pg
   ```
   This role will start a PostgreSQL instance on the weywot host.

   For yerbouti:
   ```bash
   ansible roles create yerbouti-pg
   ```
   This role will start a PostgreSQL instance on the yerbouti host.

   For waza (main server):
   ```bash
   ansible roles create waza-pg
   ```
   This role will start a PostgreSQL instance on the waza host. Ensure that this server is configured to run in production by adjusting its timeouts or specific restart parameters if necessary.

3. **Verify the Setup:**
   After setting up, you can verify that each target host has an Ansible role and the corresponding PostgreSQL instance starts.

This setup ensures that a PostgreSQL instance is started on each of your specified hosts, allowing for scalable environment management with single-node Ansible roles.
