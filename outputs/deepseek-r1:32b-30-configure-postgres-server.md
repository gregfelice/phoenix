Alright, I need to create an Ansible role to install PostgreSQL on a system. The user has provided some specific information about their existing machines, but since they're asking for a general installation role, I'll focus on that.

First, I should outline the main tasks required to install PostgreSQL. Typically, this involves updating package lists, installing necessary packages, initializing the database cluster, starting the service, and ensuring it starts at boot. Also, setting up a user with specific privileges is common.

I'll structure the role in Ansible's standard directory layout: meta, tasks, handlers, templates, and defaults. The main.yml file under tasks will contain the sequence of commands needed. I'll use apt to install PostgreSQL on Debian-based systems since that's what most of their machines are running.

For initializing the database cluster, using postgresql\_setup is appropriate. Starting the service can be done via systemd with a handler to ensure it starts after installation. Enabling the service ensures it runs on boot.

Creating a user and database requires SQL commands. I'll create a template for creating users and databases, which allows customization of names and passwords. This way, the role can be reused across different environments by adjusting variables.

Variables are important here. I'll define them in defaults/main.yml to make configuration straightforward. The user can set db\_name, db\_user, etc., as needed without altering the main task file.

I should also consider security aspects, like setting a strong password and ensuring the pg\_hba.conf is configured securely if further customization is needed. However, since this is a basic installation, I'll keep it simple but mention that more advanced configurations can be added later.

Finally, testing the role on their 'waza' machine makes sense as it's intended to be the main server. They can adjust variables in inventory or group_vars to match their specific requirements.

I'll help you create an Ansible role to install PostgreSQL Server. I'll provide actual Ansible code that you can use in your project.

Here's a complete Ansible role structure for installing PostgreSQL:

```yaml
# File: roles/postgresql_install/tasks/main.yml
---
- name: Update apt cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install PostgreSQL packages
  apt:
    name: 
      - postgresql
      - postgresql-contrib
    state: present

- name: Initialize PostgreSQL database cluster
  command: pg_createcluster --initdb "ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD='{{ postgres_password }}'"

- name: Start PostgreSQL service
  systemd:
    name:postgresql
    state:started
    enabled:yes

- name: Create PostgreSQL user and database
  template:
    src: create_user.sql.j2
    dest: /tmp/create_user.sql
  notify: run_create_user_sql

# File: roles/postgresql_install/handlers/main.yml
---
- name: run_create_user_sql
  shell: psql -U postgres -f /tmp/create_user.sql

# File: roles/postgresql_install/templates/create_user.sql.j2
CREATE ROLE {{ db_user }} WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE REPLICATION LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '{{ db_password }}';
\du
CREATE DATABASE {{ db_name }} OWNER {{ db_user }};
```

Variables needed for this role can be defined in `defaults/main.yml`:

```yaml
# File: roles/postgresql_install/defaults/main.yml
---
db_name: mydatabase
db_user: myuser
db_password: securepassword123
postgres_password: postgres
```

To use this role, you would include it in your playbook like this:

```yaml
- name: Install PostgreSQL Server on waza
  hosts: waza
  become: yes
  roles:
    - { role: postgresql_install }
```

This code will:
1. Update the package cache
2. Install PostgreSQL and contrib packages
3. Initialize the database cluster
4. Start and enable the PostgreSQL service
5. Create a new user and database using the specified credentials

The variables can be customized in your inventory or group_vars depending on your needs.

Would you like me to provide additional configurations for things like pg_hba.conf, backup configuration, or monitoring?
