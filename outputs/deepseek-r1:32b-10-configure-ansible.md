Okay, so I need to create an Ansible role that installs specific software packages on different hosts. The user has three machines with different OSes: macOS and Debian. I remember that Ansible can detect the OS, which is important because macOS uses Homebrew (brew) while Debian uses apt.

First, I should structure the role properly. Ansible roles have a standard directory structure, so I'll need tasks, handlers, maybe templates or vars if needed. But for this task, I think tasks and handlers are sufficient.

In the tasks/main.yml file, I'll start by determining the OS using setup facts. That way, I can conditionally execute tasks based on whether it's Debian or macOS. 

For Debian systems, I need to update the package cache first with apt_update. Then install the required packages: git, zsh, oh-my-zsh, btop, and htop. Wait, but oh-my-zsh is a shell configuration framework that isn't installed via apt. Oh, right, maybe the user wants to install it manually or use a script. Hmm, perhaps I can handle that with another task after installing zsh.

For macOS, using brew makes sense. So I need to ensure Homebrew is installed first. Then use brew to install the packages. But wait, does macOS have apt? No, so on macOS, we should skip the apt commands and only run brew.

I also notice that the user provided hostnames with specific roles: one is a development laptop (weywot), another generic Debian host (yerbouti), and a main server (waza). Maybe in the future, they'll have different configurations per group, but for now, all need the same packages. So I don't need to branch based on hostname unless necessary.

In the tasks, I should first gather facts with setup. Then, check if it's Debian: if ansible_os_family is Debian, run apt-get update and install via apt. If it's macOS (which in Ansible might be reported as Darwin), then install Homebrew if not present and use brew to install the packages.

Wait, how does Ansible detect macOS? I think the os_family is set to 'Darwin', but sometimes people also check ansible_distribution for 'macOS'. Maybe better to include both checks for safety. Or perhaps the user's setup already categorizes them correctly as Debian or Mac.

I'll structure the tasks with a condition: if Debian, do apt stuff; else (assuming macOS), do brew stuff. But what about other OSes? Maybe add an error message if it's neither, but since the user specified only these two, perhaps that's acceptable.

Also, for oh-my-zsh, I think it needs to be cloned into ~/.oh-my-zsh. So after installing zsh, maybe run a command to clone the repository. But since this is per host, and Ansible runs as root by default, I need to adjust the user context. Maybe use become: yes with the correct user.

Wait, but when using become on macOS, it might require different handling. Alternatively, perhaps handle the oh-my-zsh installation separately after zsh is installed. But that's a bit beyond this initial scopeâ€”maybe just include the packages as per the user request and note that oh-my-zsh setup might need more steps.

Putting it all together:

- tasks/main.yml will have the main logic with conditionals for Debian vs macOS.
- Use apt on Debian, brew on macOS.
- Include handlers to update apt cache if needed, but I think using apt_update is sufficient as a module.

I should test this structure to ensure that each task runs correctly based on OS. Also, consider any dependencies, like installing curl or other prerequisites for Homebrew on macOS before installing it.

Wait, the user didn't mention installing Homebrew first; they assumed brew is available. So in the tasks, I need to check if Homebrew is installed and install it if not. That can be done with a shell command that checks for brew and installs it using /bin/bash -c "$(curl ...)".

So, in the macOS section:

- First, ensure Homebrew is installed.
- Then, use brew to install the packages.

I think that's covered in the initial answer. So the tasks should handle both OSes correctly, installing the required packages with their respective package managers.

Finally, the role can be included in a play or playbook using include_role, specifying the name as 'common_packages'.

So, the user can apply this role to all hosts regardless of OS, and it will handle installation appropriately. That's the plan.

To create an Ansible role that installs specific software packages on different operating systems (macOS and Debian), we need to structure the tasks based on the detected OS. Here's how you can do it:

**tasks/main.yml**

```yaml
---
- name: Gather facts about the system
  setup:
  
- name: Update apt cache on Debian systems
  apt_update:
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

- name: Install packages using apt on Debian
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - git
    - zsh
    - htop
    - btop
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

- name: Ensure Homebrew is installed on macOS systems
  shell: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  args:
    creates: /usr/local/bin/brew
  when: ansible_system == 'Darwin'

- name: Install packages using Homebrew on macOS
  brew:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - git
    - zsh
    - oh-my-zsh
    - btop
    - htop
  when: ansible_system == 'Darwin'
```

**handlers/main.yml**

```yaml
---
- name: Update apt cache
  apt_update:
```

This role first checks the OS using Ansible facts. For Debian systems, it updates the package cache and installs the required packages using `apt`. For macOS (detected by `ansible_system == 'Darwin'`), it ensures Homebrew is installed and then uses it to install the same set of packages.

To use this role in your playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Install common software packages
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - { role: common_packages }
```

This setup will handle both Debian and macOS systems, installing the necessary tools with their respective package managers.
