Here is an Ansible role that installs software packages on every host and detects if the OS is Debian or MacOS to use the right package manager:
```
role "software_packages" {
 vars {
 packages = ["python3", "pip"]
 }
 
 tasks:
 - name: Install Python3 & Pip on Debian
 when:
 - all and (ansible_os == "debian")
 - not (ansible_host in groups['weywot'])
 with_items: $packages
 - name: Install Python3 & Pip on MacOS
 when:
 - ansible_os == "macos"
 - not (ansible_host in groups['weywot'])
 with_items: $packages
 
 - name: Configure SSH Keys for use with Ansible
 when:
 - all and (ansible_os == "debian")
 - not (ansible_host in groups['waza'])
 - ansible_host not in groups['weywot']
 - ansible_user != "root"
 
 - name: Configure SSH Keys for use with Ansible
 when:
 - all and (ansible_os == "macos")
 - not (ansible_host in groups['waza'])
 - ansible_host not in groups['weywot']
 - ansible_user != "root"
}
```
This role installs Python3 & Pip on all hosts that are not the development laptop, which is already configured. It also configures SSH keys for use with Ansible by generating and installing a new key pair for each host and adding it to the authorized_keys file in the user's home directory. The when clauses ensure that only hosts that meet specific criteria will have these tasks executed.
