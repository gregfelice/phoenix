  Sure! Here is a sample Ansible playbook that includes a role for installing and configuring a Tekton server:
```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure Tekton server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: tekton
      vars:
        env_name: development
        env_type: dev
        env_host: weywot
        env_user: john
        env_pass: password
```
This playbook uses the `role` module to include a role named `tekton`. The `vars` section defines variables for the environment name, type, hostname, and username. These variables are passed to the role when it is included in the playbook.

The `env_name` variable is used to specify the name of the environment (e.g., "development"). The `env_type` variable is used to specify the type of environment (e.g., "dev"). The `env_host` variable is used to specify the hostname of the machine where the Tekton server will be installed. The `env_user` variable is used to specify the username that will be used to access the Tekton server.

The `become: true` line at the beginning of the playbook indicates that the role should be run with elevated privileges (i.e., as root). This is necessary for installing and configuring the Tekton server.

You can use this playbook to install and configure a Tekton server on your development laptop, yerbouti, and waza hosts. You can modify the `env_name`, `env_type`, `env_host`, and `env_user` variables in the playbook to match your specific environment needs.

For example, if you want to install a Tekton server on a production machine called "prod-tekton" with the username "admin", you can modify the `vars` section of the playbook like this:
```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure Tekton server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: tekton
      vars:
        env_name: production
        env_type: prod
        env_host: prod-tekton
        env_user: admin
```
You can also add more variables to the `vars` section of the playbook to configure additional settings for your Tekton server. For example, you can add a variable for the database hostname and username like this:
```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure Tekton server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: tekton
      vars:
        env_name: production
        env_type: prod
        env_host: prod-tekton
        env_user: admin
        db_host: database.example.com
        db_user: admin
```
This playbook will install and configure a Tekton server on the "prod-tekton" machine with the username "admin". It will also configure the database hostname and username to be "database.example.com" and "admin", respectively.
