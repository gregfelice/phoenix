Okay, I need to figure out how to create an Ansible role that installs Docker and Helm on my servers. I have three machines: weywot (MacOS), yerbouti (Debian), and waza (Debian). 

First, I remember that Ansible uses roles to manage configurations. So, I'll need a meta file that lists the dependencies. In this case, since I'm installing Docker and Helm, maybe there are existing roles for these. Oh, right, the community.docker role is commonly used, so I'll include that.

Next, the tasks.yml file will contain the steps to install Docker and Helm. For Docker on Debian-based systems like yerbouti and waza, I should add the GPG key, set up the repository, update the package list, and install docker-ce and docker-compose. After installation, it's good practice to create a non-root user for Docker, maybe 'dockeruser', so tasks can run without sudo.

For Helm, I need to download the curl command to get the latest version. Then, add the Helm path to bashrc so it's available in the shell. But wait, on MacOS (weywot), installing Docker might be different. Maybe using Homebrew would be better there instead of the Debian package manager.

I should structure the role with separate files for each task: one for Docker setup and another for Helm. That way, it's organized and reusable. Also, variables could help if I need to adjust paths or versions later.

In the playbooks, I'll target each host appropriately. Weywot gets the docker_user variable set to 'dockeruser' as well. Yerbouti and waza will use the same role but maybe have different group memberships or other settings.

I think I covered all steps: adding repositories, installing packages, setting up users, downloading Helm, and ensuring everything is in place. Maybe testing each step locally would help catch any issues before running on all servers.

Here's an Ansible role that installs Docker and Helm for your systems:

```yaml
# meta.yml
dependencies:
  - { name: community.docker }

# tasks.yml
- name: Install Docker Prerequisites
  apt:
    state: present
    name: "{{ item }}"
    update_cache: yes
  with_items:
    - curl
    - gnupg2

- name: Add Docker GPG Key
  apt_key:
    keyserver: hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80
    key: 9FD3B16DB5CF2C47F5CDCEFF5EB55BA3D698FB8BF

- name: Add Docker Repository
  file:
    path: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
    content: "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian {{ ansible_distribution_version | lower }} stable"

- name: Update package cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install Docker
  apt:
    state: present
    name: docker-ce
    version: "{{ lookup('env', 'DOCKER_VERSION') | default('latest') }}"
  tags: [docker]

- name: Install Docker Compose
  file:
    path: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    content: |
      #!/usr/bin/env sh
      curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{{ lookup('env', 'DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION') | default('latest')}}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    mode: 0755

- name: Add Docker User
  user:
    name: dockeruser
    group: docker
    state: present

- name: Install Helm
  file:
    path: /usr/local/bin/helm
    content: |
      #!/usr/bin/env sh
      curl -fsSL -o get_helm_3 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
      chmod 700 get_helm_3
      ./get_helm_3
    mode: 0755

# vars.yml (Optional)
---
docker_user: "dockeruser"
helm_version: latest
```

To use this role, you can create a playbook like this:

```yaml
# docker-helm.yml
- name: Install Docker and Helm on specified hosts
  hosts:
    weywot:
      become: true
      vars:
        ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
        docker_user: "dockeruser"
    yerbouti:
      become: true
    waza:
      become: true

  roles:
    - role: ./roles/docker-helm
```

This role will:
1. Add the necessary repositories for Docker and Helm.
2. Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
3. Create a non-root user for Docker (dockeruser).
4. Install Helm 3.

Note: For MacOS systems (weywot), you may want to adjust the Docker installation steps or use Homebrew instead of apt.
