To create an Ansible role that installs software packages on different operating systems (Debian and macOS), you can follow the steps below. The role will detect the OS of each host and use the appropriate package manager (`apt` for Debian and `brew` for macOS).

Here's a sample role structure:

```
roles/
├── install_packages
│   ├── tasks
│   │   └── main.yml
│   └── vars
│       └── main.yml
```

### roles/install_packages/tasks/main.yml

```yaml
- name: Include OS-specific tasks
  include_tasks: "{{ os_family }}_tasks.yml"
```

### roles/install_packages/vars/main.yml

```yaml
packages:
  - git
  - zsh
  - btop
  - htop
```

### roles/install_packages/tasks/debian_tasks.yml

```yaml
- name: Update apt cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install packages using apt
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ packages }}"
```

### roles/install_packages/tasks/macos_tasks.yml

```yaml
- name: Ensure Homebrew is installed
  homebrew:
    name: brew
    update_homebrew: yes
    upgrade_all_at_end: yes

- name: Install packages using Homebrew
  homebrew:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ packages }}"
```

### Playbook to use the role

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: true
  roles:
    - install_packages
```

### Explanation

1. **Role Structure**: The role `install_packages` contains tasks and variables.
2. **Main Task File (`main.yml`)**: This file includes OS-specific task files based on the detected OS family.
3. **Variables (`vars/main.yml`)**: A list of packages to be installed is defined here.
4. **OS-Specific Task Files**:
   - `debian_tasks.yml`: Contains tasks for Debian systems using `apt`.
   - `macos_tasks.yml`: Contains tasks for macOS systems using Homebrew.
5. **Playbook**: The playbook applies the role to all hosts.

### Notes

- Ensure that the `homebrew` Ansible module is installed if you are managing macOS machines. You can install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install community.general`.
- Adjust the package names as necessary for your specific use case, especially for macOS where some packages might have different names or require additional steps.

This setup should allow you to configure your system environments effectively using Ansible roles.
