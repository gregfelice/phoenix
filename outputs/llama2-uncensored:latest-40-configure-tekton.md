To generate Ansible roles to configure your system environments, you can use the following steps:
1. Create a directory in which you want to store your role files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your role files.
3. Generate an Ansible role file by typing the following command: `ansible-galaxy init --role-file my_role` (replace "my_role" with the name of your role). This will generate a skeleton file for your role.
4. Open the generated skeleton file in your favorite text editor and edit it to suit your requirements.
5. Save and close the file.
6. Run the following command: `ansible-galaxy init --role-file my_role`. This will generate a final version of your Ansible role file.
7. Copy the generated role file to a directory where you can access it from any machine in your network.
8. To install and use an Ansible role, you need to have the Ansible Tower installed on your system. Alternatively, you can also use Ansible tower-in-a-box for self-hosting. Once you have installed Ansible Tower or Tower-in-a-Box, navigate to the directory where you want to install your role and run: `ansible-tower apply my_role`.
9. This will apply your Ansible role to the specified machines in your network.

To get working with a development, test, and production promotion cycle, and autoamted tests for react and python code using Ansible, you can follow these steps:
1. Create a directory in which you want to store your role files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your role files.
3. Generate an Ansible role file by typing the following command: `ansible-galaxy init --role-file my_role`. This will generate a skeleton file for your role.
4. Open the generated skeleton file in your favorite text editor and edit it to suit your requirements.
5. Save and close the file.
6. Run the following command: `ansible-galaxy init --role-file my_role`. This will generate a final version of your Ansible role file.
7. Copy the generated role file to a directory where you can access it from any machine in your network.

Once you have installed Ansible Tower or Tower-in-a-Box, navigate to the directory where you want to install your role and run: `ansible-tower apply my_role`.
9. This will apply your Ansible role to the specified machines in your network.
10. To set up a development, test, and production promotion cycle, you can create separate environments for each environment. For example, you can use the following command: `ansible-playbook -i inventory dev.yml` to run your playbooks in the development environment. Similarly, you can use the following command: `ansible-playbook -i inventory test.yml` to run your playbooks in the testing environment and `ansible-playbook -i inventory prod.yml` to run your playbooks in the production environment.
11. To set up autoamted tests for react and python code, you can use Ansible's built-in module `test`. For example, you can use the following command: `ansible-playbook -i inventory test_my_role.yml` to run tests on your Ansible role.
12. This will automatically generate a report of all passed and failed tests for your Ansible role.
