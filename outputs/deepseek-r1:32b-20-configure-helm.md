Okay, I need to help the user create Ansible roles to install Docker and Helm on their servers. They have three machines: weywot (MacOS), yerbouti (Debian), and waza (Debian). Weya is a Mac, so maybe they don't need Docker there? Or perhaps they do for local testing.

First, I'll create two roles: one for Docker and another for Helm. Since the user wants actual code, not pseudocode, I have to make sure each role has tasks, handlers, etc., properly structured.

For the Docker role, on Debian systems, I know we can use apt. So in tasks/main.yml, I'll add apt repositories for Docker. Then install docker.io and python3-docker. Also, ensure the user is added to the docker group so they don't need sudo every time.

On MacOS, installing Docker might be different. Maybe using Homebrew? But Ansible's homebrew module can help. So in tasks/main.yml, I'll include a condition for when the OS is Darwin (MacOS) and use homebrew to install Docker.

Next, the Helm role depends on Docker being installed because Helm uses it. So the dependencies section of meta/main.yml for Helm should include the docker role.

In tasks/main.yml for Helm, I'll download the Helm binary from GitHub releases using ansible's uri module. Then extract it and move to /usr/local/bin. After that, ensure the PATH includes this directory so Helm is accessible.

Handlers are needed to restart Docker after installation or updates. So in handlers/main.yml, add a service restart for docker.

I should also consider permissions. Maybe create a group for docker and add the user to it, especially on Debian systems.

Wait, the user didn't mention any specific users, but assuming they might want their current user added to the docker group, I'll include that in the tasks.

Testing-wise, after applying these roles, the user should have Docker and Helm installed. They can run docker commands without sudo if added to the group.

I think that covers the main points. Now, putting it all together into Ansible files as per the structure.

Here's an Ansible role to install Docker and Helm on your servers:

```yaml
# roles/docker/tasks/main.yml
- name: Add Docker GPG key
  apt_key:
    url: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

- name: Add Docker repository
  apt_repository:
    repo: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian {{ ansible_distribution_release }} stable
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

- name: Update package index
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install Docker packages
  apt:
    name:
      - docker.io
      - python3-docker
    state: present

- name: Start and enable Docker service
  service:
    name: docker
    state: started
    enabled: yes

- name: Add current user to docker group
  user:
    name: "{{ ansible_user }}"
    groups: docker
    append: yes

- name: Install Docker using Homebrew on macOS
  homebrew:
    name: docker
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Darwin'
```

```yaml
# roles/helm/tasks/main.yml
- name: Download Helm binary
  uri:
    url: https://get.helm.sh/helm-{{ helm_version }}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    dest: /tmp/helm.tar.gz

- name: Extract Helm binary
  unarchive:
    src: /tmp/helm.tar.gz
    dest: /usr/local/bin/
    remote_src: yes
    creates: /usr/local/bin/helm

- name: Make Helm executable
  file:
    path: /usr/local/bin/helm
    mode: 0755

- name: Add Helm to PATH
  lineinfile:
    dest: ~/.bashrc
    line: 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH'

- name: Install Helm using Homebrew on macOS
  homebrew:
    name: helm
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Darwin'
```

```yaml
# roles/docker/meta/main.yml
dependencies: []
```

```yaml
# roles/helm/meta/main.yml
dependencies:
  - role: docker
```

Create a playbook to apply these roles:

```yaml
# playbooks/deploy.yml
- name: Install Docker and Helm
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  roles:
    - docker
    - helm
```

To run the playbook, use:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy.yml
```

Make sure your inventory file (`inventory`) contains your servers (weywot, yerbouti, waza) with appropriate hostnames and connection details.

This setup will:
- Install Docker on all systems (using apt for Debian/Ubuntu and Homebrew for macOS)
- Configure Docker to start automatically
- Add the current user to the docker group
- Install Helm 3 (compatible with Kubernetes 1.12+)
- Make Helm executable system-wide

The roles are platform-agnostic but will handle different operating systems appropriately.

Remember to adjust permissions and ensure your SSH keys are properly set up for Ansible access to all your servers.
