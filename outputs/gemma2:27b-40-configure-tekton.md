## Ansible Role: Tekton Server

This role installs and configures a Tekton server on `waza`, setting up pipelines for development, test, and production promotion cycles with automated tests for React and Python code.

**roles/tekton-server/tasks/main.yml:**

```yaml
---
- name: Install Tekton CLI
  apt:
    name: tektoncd-cli
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install Docker and Kubernetes
  apt:
    name: docker.io kubeadm kubelet kubernetes-cli
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

- name: Enable Kubernetes Services
  service:
    name: docker kubelet
    state: started
    enabled: yes

- name: Install Tekton Server and Dashboard
  kubectl:
    namespace: tekton-pipelines
    state: present
    apply:
      src: ./tekton.yaml

- name: Wait for Tekton Deployment
  wait_for:
    host: "{{ waza }}"
    port: 8443
```

**roles/tekton-server/files/tekton.yaml:**

This file will contain the YAML definition for deploying the Tekton server and dashboard. You'll need to customize this based on your specific requirements and Kubernetes configuration.

**Additional Roles (Not Included):**


You'll need additional Ansible roles for:

* **CI/CD Pipelines:** Define Tekton pipelines for development, test, and production promotion cycles. Include tasks for building, testing (React and Python), deploying to different environments.
* **Testing Environments:** Configure separate Kubernetes namespaces or clusters for development, test, and production environments.
* **Artifact Registry:** Set up a registry like Docker Hub or Harbor for storing built images.

**Example Tekton Pipeline (development):**

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: react-pipeline
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: source
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: react-source-pvc
  tasks:
  - name: build
    taskRef:
      name: build-react
      kind: Task
  - name: test
    taskRef:
      name: run-tests
      kind: Task

```



**Important Considerations:**

* **Security:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for your Tekton server and pipelines.
* **Scalability:** Consider using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale Tekton resources based on demand.
* **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track Tekton pipeline execution and resource utilization.

Remember, this is a starting point. You'll need to customize the roles and YAML configurations based on your specific environment and application requirements.
