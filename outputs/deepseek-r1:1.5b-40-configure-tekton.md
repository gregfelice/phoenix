Okay, I need to figure out how to configure a system environment using ansible. The user wants an ansible role that installs a working Tekton server and sets up development, test, and production cycles with automated tests in React and Python.

First, I should start by setting up the necessary project structure. Using a Dockerfile makes sense for containerization because it's lightweight and efficient. I'll create a base image using my-engineered-docker because I already have specific services running, including my engine, which is crucial for the Tekton functionality. Then, I'll add the Tekton server as a service that runs when Docker starts.

Next, I need to install dependencies on each machine. Development and test machines should have all necessary packages installed. The main production host might also require some development tools, so it needs Python, PyCharm, and pytest for testing. Plus, Telemetis is needed for data storage, which might not be available in the default release.

For environments, I'll set up Docker containers with specific configurations. Development and test environments will have local storage configured to use my engine's data. The production environment should have a remote storage setup so it can access data from outside sources or different locations.

Testing is important, so I'll include unit tests using pytest in the development environment and PyCharm for CI/CD. For production, I'll set up continuous integration jobs with Git Actions to run scripts automatically. Also, including coverage tests will help ensure code quality in the production setup.

I need to make sure each machine has its own Dockerfile so that multiple environments can be managed without conflicts. This approach allows me to control environments and test efficiently. By structuring everything this way, I can easily scale if needed or move resources around as required by the user's needs.

To create an ansible role for installing a Tekton server and configuring system environments, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Ansible project**:
   - Log in to your Ansible account and create a new project.

2. **Set up the Ansible project structure**:
   - Under the "Build" section, add an Ansible directory structure.
     ```
     ..\build
       ..
       ..

       ..\build\envs
         ..
         \envs/development
         \envs/test
         \envs/production
       ..

       ..\build\tests
       ..
   ```

3. **Install dependencies on the Tekton server**:
   - Create a new Ansible file for installing dependencies on the Tekton server.
     ```ansible
     module: tekton

     depends-on: engine::v2
     depends-on: my-engine::v2
     requires: telemetis-engine@latest/telemetis-engine.c
     requires: pydub>=0.7.1

     # Install dependencies on the Tekton server
     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Configure system environments**:
   - Create a new Ansible file for configuring development, test, and production environments.
     ```ansible
     module: environment_config

     requires:
       tekton: .
       telemetis-engine::v2
       pydub>=0.7.1
       pytest
       python3
       python-dotenv

     def dev_env():
       return {
         'development_storage':
           EngineStorage(
             engine_name='my-engine',
             storage_config={
               'vectors_config': {
                 'vectorsdb_url': 'your-vectorsurl',
                 'vectorsdb_password': 'your-password',
                 'vectorsdb_user': 'your-user',
                 'vectorsdb_root_path': '/var/lib/my-engine/
               }
             },
             remote Storage: None
           )
       }

     def test_env():
       return {
         'test_storage':
           EngineStorage(
             engine_name='my-engine',
             storage_config={
               'vectors_config': {
                 'vectorsdb_url': 'your-vectorsurl',
                 'vectorsdb_password': 'your-password',
                 'vectorsdb_user': 'your-user',
                 'vectorsdb_root_path': '/var/lib/my-engine/
               }
             },
             remote Storage: None
           )
       }

     def prod_env():
       return {
         'prod_storage':
           EngineStorage(
             engine_name='my-engine',
             storage_config={
               'vectors_config': {
                 'vectorsdb_url': 'your-vectorsurl',
                 'vectorsdb_password': 'your-password',
                 'vectorsdb_user': 'your-user',
                 'vectorsdb_root_path': '/var/lib/my-engine/
               }
             },
             remote Storage: None
           )
       }

     # Setup CI/CD jobs in production environment
     ccijobs:
       test: true
      job_name: "test-env"
      job Description:
        Test your Telemetis storage with a simple script.

   ```

5. **Configure tests and automated testing**:
   - Create a new Ansible file for setting up unit, integration, and system tests.
     ```ansible
     module: test_tests

     requires:
       tekton: .
       pydub>=0.7.1

     def unit_tests():
       return {
         'tests/telemetis-test.py': (
           from subprocess import check_output
           check_output(['pytest', '--ignore-imports', '-m', 'pytest unittest.main'])
         )
       }

     def integration_tests():
       return {
         'tests/integration-test.py': (
           from subprocess import check_output
           check_output(['pytest', '--imported', '-m', 'pytest unittest.main'])
       )

     def system_tests():
       return {
         'tests/system-test.py': (1, 0),
         'tests/telemetis-test.py': (1, 0)
       }

     # Set up CI/CD jobs in production environment
     ccijobs:
       test: true
      job_name: "test-env"
      job Description:
        Test your Telemetis storage with a simple script.

   ```

6. **Install dependencies on each machine**:
   - Create a new Ansible file for installing dependencies on the development, test, and production hosts.
     ```ansible
     module: install_dependencies

     depends-on:
       tekton: .
       pydub>=0.7.1
       pytest
       python3

     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

7. **Install development environment**:
   - Create a new Ansible file for installing the development environment.
     ```ansible
     module: develop

     requires:
       tekton: .
       pydub>=0.7.1
       pytest
       python3

     def install_development():
       requirements = 'requirements.txt'
       pip install -r requirements
       pip install pydub
       pip install pytest
       pip install python-dotenv
       pip install youtube-dl
       pip install poetry
       pip install unittest2
       pip install youtubeDNS
       pip install youtubeper

     def setup_development():
       requirements = 'requirements.txt'
       pip install -r requirements
   ```

8. **Install test environment**:
   - Create a new Ansible file for installing the test environment.
     ```ansible
     module: test

     requires:
       tekton: .
       pydub>=0.7.1
       pytest
       python3

     def install_test():
       requirements = 'requirements.txt'
       pip install -r requirements
   ```

9. **Install production environment**:
   - Create a new Ansible file for installing the production environment.
     ```ansible
     module: prod

     requires:
       tekton: .
       pydub>=0.7.1
       pytest
       python3

     def install_production():
       requirements = 'requirements.txt'
       pip install -r requirements
   ```

10. **Set up CI/CD jobs**:
    - Add a CI/CD job in the development environment.
      ```ansible
      module: ci

      requires:
        tekton: .
        pydub>=0.7.1
        pytest
        python3
        youtube-dl

      def run_tests():
        pip install -r requirements.txt

      jobs:
        test:
          interval: 5s
          timeout: 30s
          job_name: "test Environment"
```

By following these steps, you will have an Ansible role that installs a working Tekton server and sets up development, test, and production environments with automated testing.
