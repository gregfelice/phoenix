Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants Ansible roles to manage software packages on different OSes and set up SSH keys. They have three machines: two Debian and one macOS.

First, I need to create a role that detects the OS and uses the appropriate package manager. For macOS, it should use Homebrew (Brew), and for Debian-based systems, it should use APT.

I'll start by writing a tasks file in Ansible. The first task will check if the host is macOS using `ansible_os_family` fact. If yes, install Brew and run the upgrade command. Next, I'll add a handler to update packages when needed.

For Debian hosts, I'll include APT modules to update the cache and install packages. This way, each OS gets handled correctly without conflicting tasks.

Then, setting up SSH keys is crucial for Ansible operations. I'll create a `files` directory in the role to hold the authorized_keys file. The task will copy this file to all target hosts, ensuring SSH access without passwords.

I also need to make sure the user runs these roles with appropriate privileges, probably using sudo for Debian and maybe an admin account for macOS. It's important to test these roles on each machine to avoid any issues during execution.

In summary, I structured the role to dynamically choose package managers based on OS, handle updates, and deploy SSH keys seamlessly across all specified hosts.

I'll help you create an Ansible role that handles different operating systems and installs software packages using the appropriate package manager. Here's the code:

```yaml
# Create a new directory structure for the role
mkdir -p roles/common/tasks/
```

Here's the content for `roles/common/tasks/main.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Check if this is macOS
  become: yes
  block:
    - name: Ensure Homebrew is installed on macOS
      homebrew:
        name: brew
        state: present
      register: brew_installed

    - name: Update packages using Brew
      shell: brew update && brew upgrade --all --with-resolver=homebrew/brew/resolver
      when: brew_installed.changed or ansible_os_family == "Darwin"

  condition: ansible_os_family == "Darwin"

- name: Handle Debian package updates
  become: yes
  block:
    - name: Update apt package cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install packages from apt
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: 
        # Add your desired packages here, e.g.:
        # - curl
        # - git
        # - python3
        # - etc.

  condition: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

- name: Create .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
  file:
    path: /home/{{ansible_user}}/.ssh
    state: directory
    mode: 0700

- name: Copy SSH public key to authorized_keys
  copy:
    src: files/authorized_keys
    dest: /home/{{ansible_user}}/.ssh/authorized_keys
    mode: 0600
```

Here's the content for `roles/common/files/authorized_keys` (replace with your actual SSH public key):

```bash
# Add your SSH public key(s) here, one per line
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E... 
```

To use this role in a playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure system environments
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - common
```

For your specific machines (weywot, yerbouti, waza), you'll want to run the playbook with appropriate tags or host filters. For example:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml --tags "packages,ssh" site.yml
```

Note: Make sure you have set up your SSH keys before running this role, and ensure that the user Ansible connects as has sudo access (or equivalent) on all target machines.

You'll need to populate `inventory.yaml` with your hosts and group them as needed. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
weywot:
  ansible_host: weywot.example.com
  ansible_user: your-user
  ansible_ssh_key_path: /path/to/ssh/private/key

yerbouti:
  ansible_host: yerbouti.example.com
  ansible_user: your-user
  ansible_ssh_key_path: /path/to/ssh/private/key

waza:
  ansible_host: waza.example.com
  ansible_user: your-user
  ansible_ssh_key_path: /path/to/ssh/private/key

[all]
weywot
yerbouti
waza
```

Remember to replace the placeholder SSH key and paths with your actual keys and connection details.
