Alright, so I need to help my colleague set up an Ansible role that installs Docker and Helm on their machines. They've already mentioned three servers with different operating systems: a macOS laptop for Weywot, a Debian-based host for Yerbouti, and a Debian server for Waza which will be used for testing and production. 

First, I should figure out the roles we can create. Since the user needs to install Docker and Helm on all these machines, each role can handle one or multiple machines as needed. 

Let me break it down:

1. **Docker Role (Weywot):** This role will be for Weywot's machine. It should install Docker, Helm, and then start them. Also, perhaps ensure that Helm is properly configured so they know to use their environment.

2. **Helm Role (Yerbouti):** Since Yerbouti runs Debian on a generic host, this role will handle it. Install Helm and Docker. Maybe also set up Helm's environment variables or configuration for this machine.

3. **Waza Role (Debian Server for Testing and Production):** This one is intended for testing purposes but should run all the necessary tools for production too. So, install Docker and Helm on Waza and start them. Also, consider enabling logging for Waza so it can capture logs when running these services.

Now, I need to write Ansible code for each role. Each role will be a separate file in the /etc/ansible/roles directory. 

For Weywot's role:
- Use Ansible to run Docker, Helm, and then start them.
- Also, ensure that Helm is enabled by setting up its environment variables or configuration.

Wait, but how do I ensure Helm is configured? Maybe I should set it up in the role so that when Waza runs, it knows where to find Helm's directories. Or perhaps just have Helm installed globally on Weywot's machine.

For Yerbouti:
- Similar setup as Weywot, install Docker and Helm, start them. Also, ensure Helm is properly configured for Debian-based systems.

For Waza:
- Install Docker and Helm.
- Start them, but don't enable logging since it's a testing environment. Maybe set up logging to capture logs from the services so that tests can be rerun later.

I should also make sure each role has all necessary dependencies. For instance, both Weywot and Yerbouti need Docker, so I need to include Docker in each role. Helm is specific to its host, so it should have Helm installed on those machines.

Let me outline the Ansible commands for each role:

For Weywot's role:
- Run containerize Docker.
- Run containerize Helm.
- Start both containers and let them run as needed.

Wait, but how do I start them in a way that they can be used in Ansible. Maybe use Ansible commands to start the containers when needed. For example:

For Weywot's role:
```
ansible command
yesl
run containerize Docker \
  with arguments "echo Weywot" and run it.
run containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Weywot" and run it.

# Let them execute as normal.

# Then, for testing purposes, start the services to be tested.
start containerize Docker \
  with arguments "echo Weywot" \
  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.
```

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe just install them and let Ansible handle their execution automatically.

Similarly for Yerbouti's role:
```
ansible command
yesl
run containerize Docker \
  with arguments "echo Yerbouti" and run it.

run containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Yerbouti" and run it.

# For testing, enable logging.
enable logging on Waza's machine when running services.

start containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Yerbouti" \
  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.
```

For Waza's role:
```
ansible command
yesl
run containerize Docker \
  with arguments "echo Waza" and run it.

run containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Waza" and run it.

# Don't enable logging since it's a testing environment. Maybe disable any other logging if needed.
disable logging on Waza when running services.

# Start the containers for testing purposes.
start containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Waza" \
  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.
```

I need to make sure that each role is properly set up with all necessary modules and dependencies. Also, configure Helm on each host if needed.

Wait, but how do I ensure Helm is installed globally? Maybe add it as a dependency in each role so it's available when running the containers. Or perhaps just install Helm on each machine before starting the roles.

Also, for Weywot's role, maybe also set up the environment variables for Docker and Helm to make them more user-friendly.

I think that's the basic structure. I'll need to write the Ansible commands in a way that they can start the containers automatically or with appropriate timeouts. Maybe use services with timeout policies so that the containers don't run indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.

I should also consider if any of these roles are intended for only one machine each, which they probably are since we have separate roles per host. So, each role is focused on a single server.

Finally, I'll write the Ansible files for each role, making sure that all necessary modules are included and dependencies are properly set up.

  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.

run containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Weywot" \
  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.

enable logging on Waza when running services.

start containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Weywot" \
  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.
```

```ansible
roles
  Yerbouti

  with arguments "echo Yerbouti" \
  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.

run containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Yerbouti" \
  then, wait until the services are started or stopped.

enable logging on Waza when running services.

start containerize Helm \
  with arguments "echo Yerbouti" \
