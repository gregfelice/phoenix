use only english. i need ansible roles to configure my system environments. use the ansible language to generate code for me. ensure you are writing actual code, NOT pseudocode or comments. i need a role that will install software packages on every host. the role needs to detect if the os is debian or macos in order to use the right package manager. if the os is macos, use brew. if the os is debian, use apt. write commands in the role to install these packages: git, zsh, oh-my-zsh, btop, htop.
